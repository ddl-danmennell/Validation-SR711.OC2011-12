## FAIRNESS AND BIAS ANALYSIS

### Demographic Parity Analysis
| Age Group | Positive Rate | Accuracy | Disparity |
|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 18-25 | 0.42 | 0.83 | -6% |
| 26-35 | 0.45 | 0.87 | -3% |
| 36-45 | 0.48 | 0.89 | 0% (ref) |
| 46-55 | 0.47 | 0.88 | -1% |
| 56+ | 0.40 | 0.82 | -8% ⚠️ |

### Fairness Metrics Summary
| Metric | Age Disparity | Gender Disparity | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Demographic Parity | 0.08 | 0.03 | ⚠️ Age exceeds threshold |
| Equalized Odds | 0.06 | 0.04 | ✅ Within limits |
| Equal Opportunity | 0.05 | 0.03 | ✅ Within limits |

### Bias Mitigation Recommendations
1. **Age-based Disparity:** Implement age-aware calibration to reduce the 8% disparity
2. **Disparate Impact:** Continue monitoring selection rates across demographic groups
3. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Establish monthly fairness audits with automated alerts
4. **Model Retraining:** Consider fairness-constrained optimization in next iteration

## ROBUSTNESS AND STABILITY TESTING

### Stress Test Results
| Scenario | Performance (AUC) | Status |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Baseline | 0.87 | ✅ Normal |
| Market Shock | 0.82 | ✅ Acceptable |
| Data Drift | 0.78 | ⚠️ Monitor |
| Feature Noise | 0.75 | ⚠️ Monitor |
| Label Shift | 0.73 | ⚠️ Monitor |

### Feature Sensitivity Analysis
Top sensitive features requiring monitoring:
1. Credit Score (15% impact)
2. Account Age (12% impact)
3. Transaction Volume (10% impact)
4. Support Calls (8% impact)

### Temporal Stability
